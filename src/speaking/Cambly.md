### Describe a website you often visit

You should say:

What it is about:
How you found out about it:
How often you visit it:
And explain why you often visit it:

One of my favorite websites is GitHub. It is a platform for software developers to store, manage, and share their code.
The most important feature of GitHub is its ability to track changes in code and manage different versions of a project.
As a software developer myself, I use GitHub extensively to work on my own projects and to collaborate with other developers.

I first discovered GitHub during my university studies in computer science. My professors recommended it as a tool for collaborating on programming assignments. It was particularly useful for group projects, as it allowed us to track everyone’s contributions and ensure we were all aligned.

Nowadays, I visit GitHub almost daily for both my job and my contributions to open-source projects. I follow numerous projects on the platform and enjoy seeing what other developers are working on. GitHub is an excellent resource for learning from others and giving back to the community. Even on weekends, I often find myself spending time on GitHub because I really enjoy coding and exploring new ideas.


### Follow-up questions:

What are the differences between old people and young people when they use the internet?

I think the main difference between old and young people when using the internet is their familiarity with technology. Young people have grown up with computers and smartphones, so they are generally more comfortable using the internet and various applications.
But older people may find the internet more challenging to navigate, especially if they didn’t grow up using computers. They may struggle with understanding how to use certain websites or applications. However, many older people are eager to learn and adapt to new technologies, so the gap between young and old internet users is narrowing.

What kinds of people would still go to the library to read and study? Is the library still necessary? Why?

There are several types of people who might still go to the library to read and study. For example, students who need access to physical books, or other resources that are not available online may visit the library. Researchers and academics may also use the library for its extensive collection of materials and quiet study spaces. So the library is still necessary for those who require access to physical books, archives, or specialized resources that are not available online.

Why do some people like to read the news on the internet instead of getting it from TV?

Reading the news on the internet has several advantages over watching it on TV. Firstly, the internet provides access to a wide range of news sources from around the world, allowing people to get a more diverse perspective on current events. Secondly, online news is often more up-to-date than TV news, as it can be published instantly. Finally, the internet allows people to access news at any time, making it more convenient than waiting for a scheduled TV broadcast.

What's the difference between the internet and television?

The internet and television are both important sources of information and entertainment, but they have several key differences. The internet is a more interactive medium, allowing users to search for specific information, communicate with others, and create content. Television, on the other hand, is a more passive medium, where viewers consume content that is broadcast to them.

What are the most popular and least popular apps in China?

Some of the most popular apps in China include WeChat, Alipay, and TikTok. WeChat is a messaging app that also offers social media, payment, and other services. Alipay is a popular mobile payment app that is widely used for online and offline transactions. TikTok, known as Douyin in China, is a short-video app that has gained popularity worldwide.

As a software developer, I’ve had some intense moments during on-call duty. One time, I got an alert that our production server was down, and it had accidentally restarted. It was a critical issue that needed immediate attention to minimize the impact on our users.

I quickly logged into the server and found that a database record was corrupted. I had to restore it from a backup and restart the server to get it back online. I moved fast and efficiently, and within 30 minutes, the server was up and running again.

### Describe a tourist attraction that very few people visit but you think is interesting

You should say:

What the place is?
What people can see there?
Why only very few people visit there?
And explain why you think it is interesting?

One of the most remote and rarely visited places is the Kekexili region in Northwest China. This area is a vast, high-altitude plateau located in the Tibetan Plateau, known for its extreme isolation and harsh environment.

In Kekexili, visitors would experience a breathtaking and desolate landscape. It is home to rare wildlife, such as the Tibetan antelope and wild yaks. It offers a unique view of nature.

The low number of visitors is mainly due to its extreme conditions. The altitude is very high, leading to thin air and harsh weather, with temperatures dropping significantly. Strict regulations to protect the environment and wildlife also limit access to the region.

Kekexili is fascinating because it’s one of the most untouched places in the world. Its tough conditions help keep the land and animals in their natural state, giving a rare chance to see nature in its purest form.

### Describe a place you visited where the air was polluted

You should say:

Where the place is
When you visited it
Why the air was not good
And explain how you felt about the place


I visited Beijing, China’s capital, in the winter of 2022. The air quality was pretty bad, with a thick haze hanging over the city most days. The pollution was mainly from industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and construction dust, made worse by the city’s rapid growth and its location, surrounded by mountains.

While I was there, the sky often had a grayish tint, and visibility was poor. A lot of people wore face masks for protection. The bad air quality really affected my experience—it was uncomfortable to breathe, and outdoor activities weren’t as enjoyable.

Even though Beijing has a rich history and some amazing landmarks, the pollution gave me mixed feelings about the city. It made me think about the environmental challenges that come with rapid urban development and the need to balance economic growth with protecting the environment.

### Follow-up questions:

Is there more pollution now than in the past?

No, there is less pollution now than in the past. Beijing has made significant progress in reducing air pollution by implementing stricter emission standards.

Do you think the city is cleaner or dirtier than the countryside? Why?

I think the city is dirtier than the countryside. The city has a lot of factories and vehicles, which release pollutants into the air. The countryside has fewer people and less industry, so at least the air is cleaner.

What can factories and power plants do to reduce pollutants?

Factories and power plants can reduce pollutants by using cleaner technologies, like renewable energy sources. They can also improve their waste management practices to reduce emissions.

Do you think the wind has any effect on pollution? How?

Yes, the wind can have an effect on pollution. When the wind blows, it can disperse pollutants and help clean the air.

In what ways can air pollution be reduced effectively?

I think air pollution can be reduced effectively by using cleaner technologies, improving waste management practices, and promoting public awareness of the issue.

Do you think many companies have been forced to reduce pollutants?

Yes, many companies have been forced to reduce pollutants by implementing stricter regulations and standards.

### Describe a time when you received good service in a shop/store

You should say:
Where the shop is?
When you went to the shop?
What service you received from the staff?
And explain how you felt about the service?

A time when I received excellent service was at the Apple Store in Chengdu. This happened about two months ago when my iPhone suddenly stopped working, and I needed it repaired. The store is located in Taikoo Li, a popular shopping area in Chengdu, so I decided to visit their Genius Bar for help.

When I arrived, I was warmly greeted by a staff member who promptly checked me in for an appointment. After a short wait, a technician assisted me and ran a diagnostic test on my phone. He quickly identified the issue as a battery malfunction. What impressed me the most was how efficient and professional he was. He explained the problem clearly, offered a free replacement since my phone was still under warranty, and told me it would only take about an hour to fix.

While waiting, the staff offered me a comfortable space to relax, and I appreciated how they kept me informed throughout the process. By the time the repair was done, my phone was working perfectly again.

I felt extremely satisfied with the service because everything was handled so smoothly, and the staff made me feel valued as a customer. It was truly a great experience, and I left the store feeling relieved and happy.
