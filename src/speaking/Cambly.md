### Describe a website you often visit

You should say:

What it is about:
How you found out about it:
How often you visit it:
And explain why you often visit it:

One of my favorite websites is GitHub. It is a platform for software developers to store, manage, and share their code.
The most important feature of GitHub is its ability to track changes in code and manage different versions of a project.
As a software developer myself, I use GitHub extensively to work on my own projects and to collaborate with other developers.

I first discovered GitHub during my university studies in computer science. My professors recommended it as a tool for collaborating on programming assignments. It was particularly useful for group projects, as it allowed us to track everyone’s contributions and ensure we were all aligned.

Nowadays, I visit GitHub almost daily for both my job and my contributions to open-source projects. I follow numerous projects on the platform and enjoy seeing what other developers are working on. GitHub is an excellent resource for learning from others and giving back to the community. Even on weekends, I often find myself spending time on GitHub because I really enjoy coding and exploring new ideas.


### Follow-up questions:

What are the differences between old people and young people when they use the internet?

I think the main difference between old and young people when using the internet is their familiarity with technology. Young people have grown up with computers and smartphones, so they are generally more comfortable using the internet and various applications.
But older people may find the internet more challenging to navigate, especially if they didn’t grow up using computers. They may struggle with understanding how to use certain websites or applications. However, many older people are eager to learn and adapt to new technologies, so the gap between young and old internet users is narrowing.

What kinds of people would still go to the library to read and study? Is the library still necessary? Why?

There are several types of people who might still go to the library to read and study. For example, students who need access to physical books, or other resources that are not available online may visit the library. Researchers and academics may also use the library for its extensive collection of materials and quiet study spaces. So the library is still necessary for those who require access to physical books, archives, or specialized resources that are not available online.

Why do some people like to read the news on the internet instead of getting it from TV?

Reading the news on the internet has several advantages over watching it on TV. Firstly, the internet provides access to a wide range of news sources from around the world, allowing people to get a more diverse perspective on current events. Secondly, online news is often more up-to-date than TV news, as it can be published instantly. Finally, the internet allows people to access news at any time, making it more convenient than waiting for a scheduled TV broadcast.

What's the difference between the internet and television?

The internet and television are both important sources of information and entertainment, but they have several key differences. The internet is a more interactive medium, allowing users to search for specific information, communicate with others, and create content. Television, on the other hand, is a more passive medium, where viewers consume content that is broadcast to them.

What are the most popular and least popular apps in China?
