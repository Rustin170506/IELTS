### Describe a website you often visit

You should say:

What it is about:
How you found out about it:
How often you visit it:
And explain why you often visit it:

One of my favorite websites is GitHub. It is a platform for software developers to store, manage, and share their code.
The most important feature of GitHub is its ability to track changes in code and manage different versions of a project.
As a software developer myself, I use GitHub extensively to work on my own projects and to collaborate with other developers.

I first discovered GitHub during my university studies in computer science. My professors recommended it as a tool for collaborating on programming assignments. It was particularly useful for group projects, as it allowed us to track everyone’s contributions and ensure we were all aligned.

Nowadays, I visit GitHub almost daily for both my job and my contributions to open-source projects. I follow numerous projects on the platform and enjoy seeing what other developers are working on. GitHub is an excellent resource for learning from others and giving back to the community. Even on weekends, I often find myself spending time on GitHub because I really enjoy coding and exploring new ideas.


### Follow-up questions:

What are the differences between old people and young people when they use the internet?

I think the main difference between old and young people when using the internet is their familiarity with technology. Young people have grown up with computers and smartphones, so they are generally more comfortable using the internet and various applications.
But older people may find the internet more challenging to navigate, especially if they didn’t grow up using computers. They may struggle with understanding how to use certain websites or applications. However, many older people are eager to learn and adapt to new technologies, so the gap between young and old internet users is narrowing.

What kinds of people would still go to the library to read and study? Is the library still necessary? Why?

There are several types of people who might still go to the library to read and study. For example, students who need access to physical books, or other resources that are not available online may visit the library. Researchers and academics may also use the library for its extensive collection of materials and quiet study spaces. So the library is still necessary for those who require access to physical books, archives, or specialized resources that are not available online.

Why do some people like to read the news on the internet instead of getting it from TV?

Reading the news on the internet has several advantages over watching it on TV. Firstly, the internet provides access to a wide range of news sources from around the world, allowing people to get a more diverse perspective on current events. Secondly, online news is often more up-to-date than TV news, as it can be published instantly. Finally, the internet allows people to access news at any time, making it more convenient than waiting for a scheduled TV broadcast.

What's the difference between the internet and television?

The internet and television are both important sources of information and entertainment, but they have several key differences. The internet is a more interactive medium, allowing users to search for specific information, communicate with others, and create content. Television, on the other hand, is a more passive medium, where viewers consume content that is broadcast to them.

As a software developer, I’ve had some intense moments during on-call duty. One time, I got an alert that our production server was down, and it had accidentally restarted. It was a critical issue that needed immediate attention to minimize the impact on our users.

I quickly logged into the server and found that a database record was corrupted. I had to restore it from a backup and restart the server to get it back online. I moved fast and efficiently, and within 30 minutes, the server was up and running again.

Fixing user issues quickly is crucial to avoid downtime, as it can really inconvenience users and hurt the company’s business. Despite the pressure, I felt a strong sense of urgency and responsibility to resolve the problem. It was a challenging situation, but I managed to stay calm and focused to get the job done.

They may want to enjoy the food and have a leisurely conversation while eating. Others may take their time to enjoy some youtube videos while eating. It takes them longer to finish their meal.

Yes, people often feel more satisfied when they finish something quickly because it gives a sense of efficiency. But it depends on the task. Some tasks require more time and effort to complete, and taking the time to do them properly can also be satisfying.

What kinds of jobs need to be done quickly?

Jobs that require quick decision-making or problem-solving skills often need to be done quickly. For example, emergency responders and customer service support need to act fast to help people in critical situations.

### Describe a tourist attraction that very few people visit but you think is interesting

You should say:

What the place is?
What people can see there?
Why only very few people visit there?
And explain why you think it is interesting?

One of the most remote and rarely visited places is the Kekexili region in Northwest China. This area is a vast, high-altitude plateau located in the Tibetan Plateau, known for its extreme isolation and harsh environment.

In Kekexili, visitors would experience a breathtaking and desolate landscape. It is home to rare wildlife, such as the Tibetan antelope and wild yaks. It offers a unique view of nature.

The low number of visitors is mainly due to its extreme conditions. The altitude is very high, leading to thin air and harsh weather, with temperatures dropping significantly. Strict regulations to protect the environment and wildlife also limit access to the region.

Kekexili is fascinating because it’s one of the most untouched places in the world. Its tough conditions help keep the land and animals in their natural state, giving a rare chance to see nature in its purest form.
