### Example

Dear Haruka,

Hello Haruka, I am writing a reply to your letter that asking for advice about whether to go to college or to try to get a job. I think trying to get a job is better for you. I would like to write reasons why.

At first, I will mention about disadvantage of going to college. I think you would not enjoy it, because in a college, especially Japanese college, you could only meet people who are around same age as you. You must have already met such a people in your junior high school and hight school. In addition to it, many students tend to just have fun with friends beside study. The reason why this happen, it is usually very difficult to enter Japanese colleges but to graduate it is not so difficult. For that reason, many students tend to just have enjoy, like have parties, going out, going travel. However college costs a huge of money on you. The fee of it is not cheap of course. I think it is waste of money to go to college.

Next, I would tell you why getting a job is good idea for you. The most valuable point is experience. Not like college, you can see many people from different age of you. By talking with them, you can get many knowledge of life and it would be good for you. Not only from people, you can also get important experience from working. You could know how different to earn the money and also you can know many social system as well.

Lastly I would like to suggest the types of job that would be suitable for you. I think you good at talking with people, so the reception of company, shool or hotel would be good. You can meet not only colleague but also many people of customers. If you would get a job of hotel, you can use your English skill as well.

In conclusion, you should try to get a job for these reason, Good luck for you.
